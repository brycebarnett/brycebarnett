This is my GitHub account that I have used during my Digital Product Management course at the University of Iowa. During the semester, I utilized tools such as HTML, CSS and Microsoft Azure. I am grateful for all the experiences that I have had during my time at Iowa and through this course. Below, I have pinned some of my favorite projects.
